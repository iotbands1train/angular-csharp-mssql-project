# Database

This folder contains the database-related code and configuration for our Angular-C#-MSSQL project. It includes migration files and the database context class for interacting with the MSSQL database.

## Folder Structure


   -----------  ------------------  ------------


## Details

- **migrations/**: Contains database migration files generated by Entity Framework Core. Migration files represent changes to the database schema over time. For example, `20240101000000_InitialCreate.cs` might contain the initial migration to create the database schema.

- **ApplicationDbContext.cs**: Represents the database context class in Entity Framework Core. This class is responsible for configuring entities and relationships, and it provides a bridge between the application and the database.

## Usage

To work with the database code:

1. Open the database folder in your preferred IDE or text editor.
2. Modify existing migration files or create new ones to represent changes to the database schema.
3. Run `dotnet ef migrations add <MigrationName>` to create a new migration based on your changes.
4. Run `dotnet ef database update` to apply the migrations and update the database schema accordingly.

## Dependencies

- Entity Framework Core
- MSSQL Server
